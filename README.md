# Data-science-competition-by-the-World-Bank-Poverty-prediction-

#In this data science competition, I need to make poverty status identification strategy for the World Bank based on the analysis and the built-up model.

#It is very important to conduct feature engineering so that you can identify the strongest predictors of poverty to help the World Bank run surveys with fewer, more targeted questions.

#Also, I predicted the probability of a given household being poor (achieved Mean Log Loss 0.154 and ranked 63 out of 2310 teams).
